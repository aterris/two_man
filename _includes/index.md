The Two-Man Rule Launcher is a Raspberry Pi powered device inspired by the [Two-Man rule.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-man_rule)

[War Games](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567), one of my favorites movies, depicts the use of the Two-Man rule for nuclear launches in the [opening scene.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ReJ3RltihME)

I'm also interested in finding ways to integrate the creation of software with the physical world. This project was an opporunity to explore these ideas while learning more about hardware.

Currently the launcher powers a manual build step in a Jenkins pipeline which deploys an app to production. However, the launcher can execute any arbitrary ruby code when it receives the launch command.

## Special Thanks

I want to thank [ThoughtWorks](http://thoughtworks.com) for encouraging and supporting the creation of this project through our 100 Days of Hardware initiative and everyone who participated.

I also want to especially thank Tim Kadom whose help was immeasurable on this project. Without his support and motivation this project would have never come to life.
